NYC AirBnB Data - TripleTen Sprint 1 Project
By: Frank Rivera


This workbook was created to analyze the vacation rental market in the Manhattan borough of New York City using data on current Airbnb listings. As an example of potential future revenue in this market, I dove deeper into the Lower East Side because, per the data, it is the most reviewed neighborhood in Manhattan. More specifically, one-bedroom listings with reviews within the last 12 months hosted by superhosts and have at least a 4.00 or above review score.
